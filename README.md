# Neural Nets


## Description
Basic implementations of convolutional neural networks and perceptron algorithms for an intrusion detection system. Implementation and testing was done using the Keras Tensorflow library as well as PyTorch, and the NSL-KDD data set. 

## Functionality
- An intrusion detection system using machine learning algorithms can perform at a high level 24/7 with minimal oversight.
